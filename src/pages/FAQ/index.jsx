            <Text className="mt10">
              A validator is an entity that participates in the consensus of the
              Ethereum 2.0 protocol.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Or in plain english, a human running a computer process. This
              process proposes and vouches for new blocks to be added to the

              </strong>
              The more votes a block gets, the more likely it is to be added to
              the chain.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Importantly, a validator’s vote is weighted by the amount it has
              at stake.

              Before a validator can start to secure the network, he or she
              needs to stake <strong>32 ETH.</strong> This forms the validator’s

              No. There is no advantage to having more than 32 ETH staked.

            <Text className="mt10">
              Limiting the maximum stake to 32 ETH encourages decentralization
              of power as it prevents any single validator from having an
              excessively large vote on the state of the chain.

              Yes but, under normal conditions, you will lose an amount of ETH
              roughly equivalent to the amount of ETH you would have gained in
              that period. In other words, if you stood to earn ≈0.01 ETH, you
              would instead be penalised ≈0.01 ETH.

              The answer to this question very much depends on how much ETH you

            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              You should certainly top up if your balance is close to 16 ETH:
              this is to ensure you don&apos;t get kicked out of the validator
              set (which automatically happens if your balance falls below 16

            <Text className="mt10">

              There is no easy answer to this question as there are many factors

            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Arguably the most impactful factor on rewards earned for
              validating transactions is the total amount of stake in the
              network. In other words, the total amount of validators. Depending
              on this figure the max annual return rate for a validator can be
              anywhere between 2 and 20%.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Given a fixed total number of validators, the rewards/penalties
              predominantly scale with the balance of the validator – attesting
              with a higher balance results in larger rewards/penalties whereas
              attesting with a lower balance results in lower rewards/penalties.

                Note however that this scaling mechanism works in a non-obvious

              Why do rewards depend on the total number of validators in the
              network?
            </Heading>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Block rewards are calculated using a sliding scale based on the
              total amount of ETH staked on the network.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              In plain english: if the total amount of ETH staked is low, the
              reward (interest rate) is high, but as the total stake rises, the
              reward (interest) paid out to each validator starts to fall.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Why a sliding scale? While we won’t get into the gory details
              here, the basic intution is that there needs to be a minimum
              number of validators (and hence a minimum amount of ETH staked)
              for the network to function properly. So, to incentivize more
              validators to join, it’s important that the interest rate remains
              high until this minimum number is reached.
            </Text>
            <Text className="mt10">
              Afterwards, validators are still encouraged to join (the more
              validators the more decentralized the network), but it’s not
              absolutely essential that they do so (so the interest rate can
              fall).

                days. After 21 days they are ejected out of the validator pool.

              automatically exited from the validator pool.

              As such, it’s a good idea to create your keys from mnemonics which

              In a nutshell, security. The signing key must be available at all
              times. As such, it will need to be held online. Since anything
              online is vulnerable to being hacked, it’s not a good idea to use
              the same key for withdrawals.
