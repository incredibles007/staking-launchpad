          For this, we need active participants - known as validators - to
          propose, verify, and vouch for the validity of blocks. In exchange,
          honest validators receive financial rewards.

          become a validator is to make a one-way {TICKER_NAME} transaction to
          the deposit contract on the current Ethereum chain.
